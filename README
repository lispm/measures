The Measures Package provides dimensioned numbers (i.e. numbers with
dimensional units, short: dim-numbers) for Common Lisp.

Contact: Rainer Joswig, joswig@lisp.de

The software was originally written by Roman Cunis, Hamburg, Germany and then
maintained by Ralf Möller.
See: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/util/lang/lisp/code/syntax/measures/0.html

This version is taken from LOOM, which has various extensions
and defines many dimensional units. See: http://www.isi.edu/isd/LOOM/

Rainer Joswig (joswig@lisp.de , 2017) removed some support for older versions
of Common Lisp, fixed some problems and updated the system definition.

System declarations for ASDF and LispWorks are provided.

The software still uses a logical pathname "MEASURES". It is set up
by loading the file "measures-sysdcl.lisp".

This version assumes a variant of ANSI Common Lisp.

Load in LispWorks:

(load "measures-sysdcl.lisp")
(compile-system :measures :load t)

Load in Clozure CL:

(require "ASDF")
(load "measures-sysdcl.lisp")
(asdf:compile-system "Measures")
(asdf:load-system "Measures")


Use:

CL-USER 2 > (ms:dim* #M10kg #M10min)
#M6000kg.s
