The Measures Package provides dimensioned numbers (i.e.  numbers with
dimensional units, short: dim-numbers) for Common Lisp.

The software was originally written by Roman Cunis, Hamburg, Germany and then
maintained by Ralf Möller.
See: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/util/lang/lisp/code/syntax/measures/0.html

This version is taken from LOOM, which has defined various extensions
and a lot of dimensional units. See: http://www.isi.edu/isd/LOOM/
See the LOOM Public License:

This product includes software developed by and/or derived from
the LOOM Project (http://www.isi.edu/isd/LOOM/LOOM-HOME.html) to
which the U.S. Government retains certain rights.

Rainer Joswig (2017) removed some support for older versions of Common Lisp,
fixed some problems and updated the system definition.

System declarations for ASDF and LispWorks are provided.

The software still uses a logical pathname "MEASURES". It is setup
by loading the file "measures-sysdcl.lisp".

This version assumes a variant of ANSI Common Lisp.
